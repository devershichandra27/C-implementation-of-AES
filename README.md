# C program for AES

I've tried to code a simplest implementation of Advanced Encryption Algorithm using C language.
Currently the program takes a hardcoded 16 byte plaintext and key, and encrypts them.

It's 5:00 in the morning and I've just finished debugging this program (successfully).. so there might be chances of improvization

Suggestions for the same are always welcome. :-)

Happy Coding!
